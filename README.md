Show AI lets you “teach” AIs how to perform tasks from just a screen recording.

Started at the Gemini x TED AI Hackathon (Oct 2025)

What we're building: Instead of writing lengthy prompts for AI agents to perform task the way you do, what if you could just show it a screen recording of you doing it with some light narration. Show AI will extract the "skill" (bundle of instructions, scripts, templates, etc. depending on the task) which can then be used by AI agents to perform the task.

Built with Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model.
