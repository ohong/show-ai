# Categorize and Approve YNAB Transactions

This skill outlines the process of navigating to the YNAB (You Need A Budget) platform, categorizing individual transactions, and approving them to maintain an organized budget.

## Prerequisites

- An active YNAB (You Need A Budget) account.
- Uncategorized transactions available in your YNAB account.
- A web browser (e.g., Firefox, Chrome).

## Procedure

### Step 1: Navigate to the YNAB Website
**Objective:** Access your YNAB account where transactions are listed.

**Instructions:**
1. Open your web browser.
2. In the address bar, type `https://app.ynab.com/42e9630a-4c35-4b93-8f9f-3c2a3fe11efb/accounts`.
3. Press `Enter` to navigate to the YNAB website.
4. Allow time for the page to load and display your "All Accounts" overview.

**Verification:**
- The browser displays the YNAB interface with a list of transactions, and the title "All Accounts" is visible.

### Step 2: Categorize the First Transaction
**Objective:** Assign a category to an un-categorized transaction.

**Instructions:**
1. Locate the first transaction in the list that displays the label "This needs a category".
2. Click the "This needs a category" button associated with that transaction. A dropdown menu with category options will appear.
3. Scroll through the available categories to find the most appropriate one for the transaction.
4. Click on the desired category (e.g., "Stuff I forgot to plan for").

**Verification:**
- The "This needs a category" label is replaced by the selected category name.

### Step 3: Approve the Categorized Transaction
**Objective:** Confirm the categorization and remove the transaction from the "Unapproved" list.

**Instructions:**
1. After selecting a category, locate and click the "Approve" button, typically appearing on the right side of the transaction row.

**Verification:**
- The categorized transaction disappears from the "All Accounts" list.
- The "Unapproved" transaction count (e.g., `View: Unapproved (10)` becomes `(9)`) decreases by one.

### Step 4: Repeat for Remaining Transactions
**Objective:** Continue categorizing and approving all pending transactions.

**Instructions:**
1. For each subsequent transaction displaying "This needs a category", repeat Step 2 and Step 3. Select the appropriate category and then click "Approve".
   - *Example 1 (similar transaction)*: Click "This needs a category", select "Stuff I forgot to plan for" from the suggested categories, then click "Approve".
   - *Example 2 (transportation)*: Click "This needs a category", scroll to and select "Transportation", then click "Approve".
   - *Example 3 (taxes/fees)*: Click "This needs a category", scroll to and select "Taxes and other fees", then click "Approve".

**Verification:**
- The "Unapproved" transaction count continues to decrease as each transaction is approved.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All transactions initially marked "This needs a category" have been assigned a category.
- [ ] All categorized transactions have been approved.
- [ ] The "Unapproved" count in the YNAB interface shows `(0)` or a significantly reduced number based on how many transactions were processed.
