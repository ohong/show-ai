# Create YouTube Thumbnails with AI

This skill leverages AI to generate YouTube thumbnails. It utilizes Gemini for image creation and ChatGPT for prompt engineering to create thumbnails that are click-worthy.

## Prerequisites
- Access to Google Gemini (Gemini.google.com)
- Access to ChatGPT (chat.openai.com)
- A YouTube thumbnail to use as a reference (optional, but recommended)
- Video script (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Access Gemini
Open Gemini in a web browser.

### Step 2: Select Gemini Flash
In Gemini, choose "2.5 Flash" for faster all-around help.

### Step 3: Create Image
Tap the "Create Image" tool. A banana icon indicates image creation capability.

### Step 4: Upload Thumbnail Reference (Optional)
Upload a thumbnail to Gemini as a reference for desired layout and style.

### Step 5: Open ChatGPT
Open ChatGPT in a web browser.

### Step 6: Upload Thumbnail Reference to ChatGPT (Optional)
Upload the same thumbnail used in Gemini (if any).

### Step 7: Describe Desired Edits to ChatGPT
Describe the desired edits to the thumbnail in ChatGPT and ask it to write a professional prompt. For example:
```text
I've attached a YouTube thumbnail as a reference. Write a clear, professional prompt for an AI image generation tool to recreate a similar layout with these changes:
- Remove the boy.
- Make both channel panels look like stick-figure animation channels; use stick-figure imagery in each panel.
- Title text: 'Monetize in 7 Days' (bold, ultra-readable).
- Background: solid dark blue with soft light vignette/glow.
- Keep the overall composition, spacing, and typography hierarchy similar for high CTR.
- Output should be high detail, 4K, clean edges, no artifacts, no watermarks.
```

### Step 8: Copy ChatGPT's Prompt
Copy the generated prompt from ChatGPT.

### Step 9: Paste Prompt into Gemini
Go back to Gemini and paste the prompt into the image description field.

### Step 10: Generate Image in Gemini
Click "Generate". Gemini will create a new thumbnail based on the prompt.

### Step 11: Add Your Photo (Optional)
If desired, upload a photo to Gemini and type a request to include the photo in the thumbnail, such as:
```text
Add my image to the thumbnail and make it fit perfectly with the existing style
```
Then hit "Generate" again.

### Step 12: Refine the Thumbnail (Optional)
To make quick changes, add single-line instructions to the prompt and regenerate. For example:
```text
Set the title in bright yellow, bold, ultra-readable at first glance.
```
Then hit "Generate" again.

### Step 13: Generate Thumbnail from Video Script (Optional)
If a reference thumbnail is not desired, paste the video script into ChatGPT and ask it to write a concise image generation prompt for a text-only YouTube thumbnail that fits the script. Then, copy the generated prompt from ChatGPT, paste it into Gemini, and hit "Generate".

## Troubleshooting

- If Gemini doesn't nail the brief on the first try, refine the prompt in ChatGPT and regenerate.
- Ensure the image uploaded in Gemini is available as a reference.

## Expected Outcome

A click-worthy YouTube thumbnail is generated by Gemini, based on the detailed prompt engineered by ChatGPT. The thumbnail should align with the desired style, include requested edits, and incorporate the uploader's photo if specified. No Photoshop skills should be needed.
